// In JS there are 4 ways to create varibales.
// We have the more modern one, let and const to create variable
let a = 6; 
let b = 'hello';
const c = 3.14; //Creates constant, cannot change with primitive values
let d = true;


// We then have the classicla way to define the variables:
var f = 8; //Allows hoisting, that allows you to use the variable before declaring it

//We can also declare a variable with no previous declaration
//j = 9; Not allowed in strict mode, so we don't use it
